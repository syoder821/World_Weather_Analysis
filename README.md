# World_Weather_Analysis

Updates have been requested to the initial PlanMyTripp app submitted for Beta testing.  This update adds the weather description to the weather data retrieved as well as allowing users to filter the data for their weather preferences.  The filterd weather data will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  From the list of potential travel destinations, the user will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.  Usins the Google Maps Directions API a travel route between the four cities is created as well as a marker layer map.
